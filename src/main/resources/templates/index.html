<p><strong>Rome: A Brief History</strong><br /><br/>
    From its founding in 625 BC to its fall in AD 476, the Roman Empire conquered and integrated dozens of cultures.</br>
    The influence of these cultures can be seen in objects, such as oil lamps, made and used throughout the Empire.</br>
    <br />

    <br />
    <em>The history of the Roman Empire can be divided into three distinct periods: The Period of Kings (625-510 BC), Republican Rome (510-31 BC), and Imperial Rome (BC 31-476 AD).</em></p>

            <p><strong>Founding (c. 625 BC)</strong><br />
            <p class="style1">Rome was founded around 625 BC in the areas of ancient Italy known as Etruria and Latium. It is thought that the city-state of Rome was initially formed by Latium villagers joining together with settlers from the surrounding hills in response to an Etruscan invasion. It is unclear whether they came together in defense or as a result of being brought under Etruscan rule. Archaeological evidence indicates that a great deal of change and unification took place around 600 BC which likely led to the establishment of Rome as a true city.<br />
            <p><strong>Period of Kings (625-510 BC)</strong><br />
            <p class="style1">The first period in Roman history is known as the Period of Kings, and it lasted from Rome?s founding until 510 BC. During this brief time Rome, led by no fewer than six kings, advanced both militaristically and economically with increases in physical boundaries, military might, and production and trade of goods including oil lamps. Politically, this period saw the early formation of the Roman constitution. The end of the Period of Kings came with the decline of Etruscan power, thus ushering in Rome?s Republican Period.<br />
